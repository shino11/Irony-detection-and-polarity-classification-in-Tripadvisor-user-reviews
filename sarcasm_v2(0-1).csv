GEN,1,GEN_sarc_0004,This is pure paranoia. What evidence do you have to support you're point of view? Why don't you actually do a little research yourself. Handgun Control Inc was founded by two victims of gun-violence. Sarah Brady joined Handgun Control Inc after her husband received brain damage from a bullet. Senator Ted Kennedy also supports gun-control because some of his family members were killed with guns. Many people who support gun control have experienced the horrors of gun violence firsthand and are just trying to make our nation a safer place. It's not because they are power hungry.,"Evidence, I dont need no sticking evidence. This is what I beleive, and thats it, but I will dig up some proof that supports my point."

GEN,1,GEN_sarc_0010,"marriage has other important functions? like what? i'm not going by what anyone has told me, i'm going by what i see: men typically marry for steady *****, women typically marry because they want kids (eventually counts) or they want someone else to come home to and don't mind the side effect of kids.","HOLY COW!!!! Is this the ""Sacred Institution of Marriage"" you and jyoshu are so fervent to protect?"
GEN,1,GEN_sarc_0011,The statement was made based upon historical evidence. Practices such as loyalty oaths and fire safety ordinances were common place in colonial times and could be regarded as restrictions on the bearing of arms for effective self defense. The supreme court never determined that these were unacceptable restrictions or infringements.,So a gun is a fire hazard in a public place? I gotta say the gun haters are getting more creative with their arguments.

American oil companies are still trying to get a preferential deal in their dealing with the Iraqi government.Now, what are the gringos and their lackeys (UK, NATO members et al) doing in Afghanistan, which has no oil, and no rubber? Are the gringos trying to protect and control the supply of heroin ? Myabe Saddam hid his WMDs (Weapons of Mass Delusion) in Kabul or nearby?",Quite amusing that you refer to westerners as Gringos.

These countries haven't been around that long remember (in terms of the type of government).","Ah, historical inevitability. I had no idea you were a marxist, Steeeeve!

GEN,1,GEN_sarc_0019,lol.. Considering where the Dow was before Obama came into Office I think a little 270 point drop isn't going to effect anything.,You can thank Slick Willie Clinton who pushed through the sub-prime lending fiasco that eventually blew up under Bush.

GEN,1,GEN_sarc_0030,"Since evolution can't prove the book of Genesis (ancient history) false, and creationism does have some historical backing, they are comparable and they directly conflict.","Only those ignorant of science and evolution think that ""evolution"" has anything to do with the Bible. I guess that's because creationism is an attempt to pretend that mythology is somehow scientific and makes silly statements about science. It seems that science is somehow anti-Bible in that case when science debunks ignorance."
GEN,1,GEN_sarc_0031,Still dumb to compare the two. Both are no good. Theft is better then murder...however a theif bragging because he didn't murder is a fool..Chris Rock actually did a funny skit on this.,"So why did you say pot was worse than alcohol?

GEN,1,GEN_sarc_0036,"It doen't matter what trimester it is in. The shear fact that you are arguing over something as irrelevant as the trimester of the pregnancy means that you already understand that a decision to have an abortion is an intent to take a life. By arguing if the baby is considered living, is just people's way of trying to justify what they already know is wrong, hoping that the excuse of ""if the baby isn't conscious of it, then it isn't that wrong."" It doesn't matter if the baby knows it or not. Even if it was conscious of it, it won't care in a second. The moral dilemma comes in that, you had the intent of killing and that is what makes abortion in any stage morally wrong!!!!The better question is, Should the government take action? because this is a wierd situation where the life is still 100% dependent of the mom and therefore a part of her body. The argument of a soul is negligable because there is no proof of the exsistence to of souls.I have no answer for you, just a plea to please keep an open mind and have compassion for both sides of the argument. It is the only way we can create progress and not hate.","We all agree that abortion is ""killing"". Killing something that has yet to become self aware is different IMO. Funny you request an open ""mind"". My point is that it ain't a human being if it ain't got no mind. That's why they unplug you when you're brain dead."

GEN,1,GEN_sarc_0038,is this what politics and leading a country comes down to? could a picture of kerry in a bunny suit (even if it was a real bunny suit) really sway voters? or is this just to amuse already-established bush supporters?,"It probably was a bunny suit that he was supposed to wear. I guess he changed his mind, once again, and decided to wear this suit."
GEN,1,GEN_sarc_0039,"The liberal left is not mainstream, Trebor. Just check the last election on that one.","THe religious reigh is not mainstream either.

GEN,1,GEN_sarc_0040,Indeed where would one find better information. Certainly not from biblical accounts emoticonXDonno But I am not about to turn this thread into an platform for where you are trying to go.,"I'm not going anywhere with this thread.

GEN,1,GEN_sarc_0043,"Second, in this very thread Arch has deliberately tied the two as one. There are at least three posts here where he has just done that. You'll notice right off the bat, despite a distinct clarification of YEC, and NOT Christanity as a whole, that Arch deliberately takes the discussion on YEC as a discussion on Christanity. Notice that the only person who argued the thread from a Christanity as a whole view was Arch. The rest of us deliberately stated otherwise.","So what you're saying is that by mentioning both in the same post, I'm saying that unless someone is a YEC then they aren't a christian? Because that is what you attributed to me. Yet you have yet to post evidence of me saying that to anyone. Nor have you supported your original claim here, you said this: Last I checked, no credible fossil fuel firm hired YEC geologists. Prove this assertion since you researched it thoroughly enough to start a thread about."
GEN,1,GEN_sarc_0044,"In effect you are asking ""To those of you who don't believe in Adam and Eve - what does Adam and Eve mean?"" which is, a nonsense question to put forward.You might be trying to invoke debate from Christians who take a non-literal Biblical approach, if this is what you desire, you have not put the question properly.",We came from apes not created.

GEN,1,GEN_sarc_0050,"The reason his sentiments confirm the worst fears of creationists isn't because Lewontin alone has those sentiments, it's because creationists can clearly see those sentiments in the NY Times editorial board, CNN, ABC, Dan Rather, Handgun Control, The Sierra Club - the list is almost endless.

Paul attributes the moral depravity of men and women to their rejection of ""the truth of God"" (1:25). They refused ""to retain God in their knowledge"" (1:28), thereby dethroning God and deifying themselves.

[since this essay was written, they have found some post-cranial bones.] post-cranial bones are bones below the skull. so, all they have found is a skull. they don’t have a single pakicetus rib. they don’t have any pakicetus vertebrae. no other bones of any kind. just a skull--and a fragmentary one at that. why do they think it came from a whale ancestor? because its teeth look like whale teeth. but when they look at the ear bones, there is nothing to indicate that it could hear underwater. the skull was found in association with other fossils that lived on the bank of a river or along the sea shore. yet it “demonstrates a mixture of traits which are unique to the terrestrial mesonychids as well as marine whales, and indicates that the cetaceans [whales] are descended from the mesonychid carnivores.” in a whale of trouble so the claim is made based only on the teeth because no other evidence supports such a conclusion. that's real complete and reliable information that justifies making such an absolute claim from. not!!! emoticonxdonno","Only some? what's this then:  hxxp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Pakicetus_(1).jpg  Replace the xx with tt in case you're wondering why I put the link up like that, it's the stupid post count thingy."

GEN,1,GEN_sarc_0578,Without question my largest beef with God would have to be the fact that according to the Bible you need to believe in God in some fashion or another in order to make it into heaven. The reason this is my beef with him is because it is much more difficult to believe in him when you are born in India than if you are born in the US or Europe. The Indian culture is that of Hinduism and a mix of other religions unlike that of the US and Europe which is primarily Christian. That means being born in the US or Europe gives you a better chance of making it to heaven as you are more likely to end up being a Christian and believing in God. Would the be at all fair if this were the case? My answer is plainly and simply no! It is idiotic infact. If God existed and he was perfect then almost without a doubt he would have to base getting into heaven on the actions of a person instead of the beliefs of a person to be fair. His system would not be at all perfect if being born in one place means you get into heaven while being born in another place means you don't get into heaven. Furthermore this means that he needs to take into consideration other influences on your life including whether or not your parents or community were proper places to grow up and whether or not you were ever given the proper situation in which to change your life to God's expectations. If not given any opportunities or given very few and still turning out to be a decent person should be better than if you turned out to be a decent person and were given many opportunities to end up this way. God in all his perfection would need a very complicated system to judge who gets into heaven in order for it to be fair but I just don't see spelled out in the Bible.,"Why would anyone want to get to Heaven?

TQ doesn't, and of course he'll tell you that I don't. There's a big difference between science, and the creation/ evolution controversy. Many atheists who seem to be interested in science are actually only interested in it to the point that it helps them feel “intellectually fulfilled”, to discredit religion. Some of the best reading on the creation/evolution controversy isn't written by scientists, but by philosophers who have done just enough scientific homework on the subject to keep a clear focus on the controversy, without confusing it with too much detail. Michael Ruse and Bradley Monten are two excellent atheist authors on the subject. Religious authors, practically too many to name. William Dembski, David Berlinski, Phillip Johnson, Cornelius Hunter, many others. You would do well to read anything by any of these people. Far too many young people seem to make the mistake of getting most all of their information from rabid atheists who are also degreed biologists, like Richard Dawkins. He's become a celebrity, and most degreed biologists who are not rabid atheists are a little to timid to take him on in a very direct way, without fear of discrimination, academic or otherwise. Michael Behe is one of the few who has been somewhat successful at it, not in avoiding discrimination, but in his ability to make a comfortable living in spite of it. Read “The Edge of Evolution”, or “Darwin's Black Box” sometime. :)","Oh yes, Mr Behe makes a comfortable living out of selling to the ignorant.

GEN,1,GEN_sarc_0885,"MEXICO CITY – Guards and officials at a prison in northern Mexico allegedly let inmates out, lent them guns and allowed them to use official vehicles to carry out drug-related killings, including the massacre of 17 people last week, prosecutors said Sunday.After carrying out the killings the inmates would return to their cells, the Attorney General's Office said in a revelation that was shocking even for a country wearied by years of drug violence and corruption.""According to witnesses, the inmates were allowed to leave with authorization of the prison director ... to carry out instructions for revenge attacks using official vehicles and using guards' weapons for executions,"" office spokesman Ricardo Najera said at a news conference.The director of the prison in Gomez Palacio in Durango state and three other officials were placed under a form of house arrest pending further investigation. No charges have yet been filed.Prosecutors said the prison-based hit squad is suspected in three mass shootings, including the July 18 attack on a party in the city of Torreon, which is near Gomez Palacio. In that incident, gunmen fired indiscriminately into a crowd of mainly young people in a rented hall, killing 17 people, including women.Police found more than 120 bullet casings at the scene, and Najera said tests matched those casings to four assault rifles assigned to guards at the prison.Similar ballistics tests linked the guns to earlier killings at two bars in Torreon, the capital of northern Coahuila state, he said. At least 16 people were killed in those attacks on Feb. 1 and May 15, local media reported.Najera blamed the killings on disputes between rival drug cartels. ""Unfortunately, the criminals also carried out cowardly killings of innocent civilians, only to return to their cells,"" he said.Coahuila and neighboring Durango are among several northern states that have seen a spike in drug-related violence that authorities attribute to a fight between the Gulf cartel and its former enforcers, known as the Zetas.Mexico has long had a problem with investigating crimes, catching criminals and convicting people. Reports estimate less than 2 percent of crimes in Mexico result in prison sentences. But Sunday's revelation suggests that even putting cartel gunmen in prison may not prevent them from continuing to commit crimes.Interior Secretary Francisco Blake said the revelation ""can only be seen as a wake-up call for authorities to address, once again, the state of deterioration in many local law enforcement institutions ... we cannot allow this kind of thing to happen again.""Also Sunday, Mexican federal police announced the arrest of an alleged leading member of a drug gang blamed in recent killings and a car-bombing in the violence-ridden border city of Ciudad Juarez, across from El Paso, Texas.Police described Luis Vazquez Barragan, 39, as a top member of La Linea gang, the enforcement arm of the Juarez cartel, saying he received orders directly from cartel boss Vicente Carrillo Fuentes.Vazquez Barragan allegedly organized payments, moved drugs and oversaw a system of safe houses in and around Ciudad Juarez.Police said he held the same rank as fugitive gang leader Juan Pablo Ledezma, though Vazquez Barragan is not named on reward or most-wanted lists published by the Attorney General's Office, as Ledezma is.La Linea has been blamed for a car bomb that killed three people July 15 in Ciudad Juarez and for two separate shootings March 13 that killed a U.S. consular employee and two other people connected to the consulate.Police did not say when they caught Vazquez Barragan, but he was allegedly in possession of about a half-kilogram (pound) of cocaine and two guns.His arrest led to a raid on a safe house where authorities detained four suspects and freed a kidnap victim.Also Sunday, the Attorney General's Office said soldiers on patrol in Ciudad Madero in the border state of Tamaulipas seized an arsenal of about three dozen guns, 17 grenades and thousands of bullets in a house.Elsewhere in Tamaulipas, police and prosecutors raided a lot full of truck-pulled tankers in the border city of Reynosa and seized two loaded with oil of a type sometimes stolen from the pipelines of the state-owned Petroleos Mexicanos. Nore than a dozen other tankers and freight containers were also seized.Mexican drug cartels have allegedly become involved in increasingly sophisticated thefts of fuel and oil from Mexico's pipelines.In the Pacific coast state of Guerrero, authorities reported Sunday they had found the bullet-ridden bodies of six men dumped in various locations, including three in or around the resort of Acapulco. Two of the dead men were identified as people kidnapped earlier in the month.","So somebody try and tell us, that with stuff like this going on, that America still needs to overhaul its gun laws to bring them more in line with those of Mexico."

And soon, I no longer had the breath to say them; I was dead.I felt myself rising. I was being carried by a huge angel into a big beautiful place. I was still crying, but the physical pain was gone.

I am sorry, my child; for I know how it feels."" I don't know what abortion is; I guess that's the name of the monster.

GEN,1,GEN_sarc_1296,"'white guilt is the biggest flaw in the american psyche', says dr. david yeagley, comanche indian source: comanche_patriot —————————— white pride and white guilt today in the united states and most of the white world, as soon as a white child begins his formal education, he is implicitly told that he should feel guilt for the crimes of his ancestors. guilt for finding, conquering, enslaving, and killing off non-whites around the globe ... and littering in the process. this guilt stems not from his own crimes, but from the supposed crimes of other (dead) people of the same race. but the child is never encouraged to take pride in the amazing achievements of his race. more: white pride and white guilt —————————— white guilt, obamamania, and the reality of race supporting obama for president, like supporting colin powell a decade ago, is seen by many whites as the ultimate in white guilt repellent. i don't recall ever meeting any white person who personally felt guilty for the troubles of african-americans. but i've known many whites who want to loudly blame other whites for black difficulties. more: vdare.com: 01/02/07 - white guilt, obamania, and the reality of race —————————— white guilt = black power white guilt is best understood as a vacuum of moral authority. whites live with this vacuum despite the fact that they may not feel a trace of personal guilt over past oppression of blacks. whites simply come to a place with blacks where they feel no authority to speak or judge and where they sense a great risk of being seen as racist. one terrible feature is that it means whites lack the authority to say what they see when looking at blacks and black problems. political correctness is what whites have the authority to say about blacks, no matter what they see. it is a language of severely limited authority, of euphemisms that steer whites around associations with racism. the muteness that white guilt imposes on whites undergirds black power. it lets blacks live inside the silence of whites, and have our weaknesses be unutterable by whites even as they are plainly visible. messrs. jackson and sharpton are enforcers of white silence. and when whites are silent, black mediocrity is no deterrent to black advancement. everywhere that minorities press institutions today as groups, there is an erosion of excellence. the reason for this is that white guilt allows institutions to respond only with deference – deferring to the greater moral authority of minorities by lowering standards, and remaining mute to minority mediocrity, to save the institution from the racist label. so whites have made it socially virtuous to defer and stand aside as institutions erode. the public schools are all but devastated, universities are stunted by ideology, corporations are more unctuous than churches, the media are more unctuous yet, and american politicians – of left and right – speak in barren clichés about all of this when they speak at all. more: white guilt = black power —————————— white guilt...myth or reality? shana attends a big 12 school and is always seeing white girls her age or younger propositioned by black men who get offended if rebuffed. she personally knows of one girl who had her entire social life ruined by a black man who called her a racist at a party because she would not be alone with him. 'he said something like, 'xxxx, you just won't be wit' me 'cause i be black'.' a hush settled over the crowd and a bunch of people looked at her like she was a pariah. the girl ended up going back home when all of her dormmates started harassing her for being a 'bigot'. white guilt is when a white person feels sorry for a person of color to such a point that they sacrifice their own rights, and often their own self-respect in a futile hope that somehow their action will atone for the real or imagined sins of their ancestors. arabs had slaves. as long as the slave was not muslim it was legal. arabs were even the organizers of the african slave trade to the west. yet there is no arab guilt over slavery. the romans had their entire economy powered by slaves. and often their own people were slaves. yet there is no italian or roman guilt. and the ultimate irony about the american slave trade was that many african tribes made raids on other tribes and then sold their human booty to western or arabic slavers, yet there is no african guilt. why white guilt then? one of the reasons is the media. more: queen of succubi presents white guilt fact or myth? —————————— white guilt: today, tomorrow, and forever just recently, after declining a funding request from one of chicago’s numerous beggars, i heard a most peculiar thing. the man yelled at me as i walked away: “i’m sorry i’m not white.” at first i assumed he was talking to someone else; then i saw that he wasn’t. his tactic must have been an attempt to shame pedestrians into giving him more change. presumably, as the man did not look like a novice to this ancient profession, it must be a strategy that, with the exception of this occasion, works, which tells us quite a bit about the psyche of caucasian americans. more: american renaissance news: white guilt: today, tomorrow, and forever —————————— the myths behind white guilt - part 1. the slave trade one of the many weapons which our opponents use against us, and also against others of european ancestry, is often termed historical white guilt. those who hate us point accusingly to our empire, and to our involvement in the transatlantic slave trade with the implication that we, particularly the british and european americans, are uniquely guilty of crimes against other races. they believe that, by making us feel guilty about our past, we will be less inclined to object to what is done to us on behalf of our alleged 'victims'. more: the myths behind white guilt - part 1. the slave trade | national policy institute here is an accurate depiction of white guilt at work every day in north america and europe. .","Oh Blah!

GEN,1,GEN_sarc_1406,"Anyone who suggests abortion is a dispute between the rights of a woman and a fetus is trying to mislead you or is negligent about the nature of abortion rights. This isn't a dispute between woman vrs fetus but instead an issue between a woman's right to abortion and the interests of a small yet powerful vocal minority who believe they can project their views upon the majority. Rights are not simply just passed out but are based upon interest…something the Supreme Court based their conclusion during Roe v Wade. In the many years that have supported abortion rights I have never found a single pro-lifer who could prove, outside their opinion and others, how a fetus has an interest in being born. Unfortunately for them, fetuses have never elected pro-lifers to speak their behalf of but instead vice-versa. The pro-life movement plays as a self-appointed representative towards fetuses despite a lack of evidence or substance as to why a fetus, at the moment of conception, has an interest in living. So the debate is just whittled down to two factions; those who believe that abortion is a right provide to women or that a minority can oppress their views upon others because it happens to offend their beliefs. Women have a right to abortion because, as a nation, we have an invested interest in keeping abortion legal for them. For nearly 70 years we know that the fruits of coercion childbirth do not payoff…they lead to the corruption of law enforcement, provide criminals another avenue of wealth, wreck death and mutilation upon desperate women, destroy the healthcare system and leave behind an underground abortion rate that is rarely addressed by those who support coercion childbirth in the first place. Fetuses are immune from having an self-interest in being born because they have never developed such feelings in the sheer majority of abortion ever performed. Their brains are often far too primitive to hold such emotions or even awareness. If the fetus is incapable of feeling outraged or offended by being aborted then what is the big deal?

Later, with our increased understanding of genetics, it was thought perhaps Natural Selection in conjunction with genetic mutation allowed for the development of all species from a common ancestor.

By 1970, the earth was determined to be 3.5 billion years old, and by the 1990's, the earth had become 4.6 billion years old.

For example, moon drift, earth rotation speed, magnetic field decay, erosion rates, chemical influx into the oceans, ocean salinity, etc, all constrain the possible age of the earth.

GEN,0,GEN_notsarc_0081,"Within the community of Christian believers there are areas of dispute and disagreement, including the proper way to interpret Holy Scripture. While virtually all Christians take the Bible seriously and hold it to be authoritative in matters of faith and practice, the overwhelming majority do not read the Bible literally, as they would a science textbook. Many of the beloved stories found in the Bible – the Creation, Adam and Eve, Noah and the ark – convey timeless truths about God, human beings, and the proper relationship between Creator and creation expressed in the only form capable of transmitting these truths from generation to generation. Religious truth is of a different order from scientific truth. Its purpose is not to convey scientific information but to transform hearts.We the undersigned, Christian clergy from many different traditions, believe that the timeless truths of the Bible and the discoveries of modern science may comfortably coexist. We believe that the theory of evolution is a foundational scientific truth, one that has stood up to rigorous scrutiny and upon which much of human knowledge and achievement rests. To reject this truth or to treat it as “one theory among others” is to deliberately embrace scientific ignorance and transmit such ignorance to our children. We believe that among God's good gifts are human minds capable of critical thought and that the failure to fully employ this gift is a rejection of the will of our Creator. To argue that God's loving plan of salvation for humanity precludes the full employment of the God-given faculty of reason is to attempt to limit God, an act of hubris. We urge school board members to preserve the integrity of the science curriculum by affirming the teaching of the theory of evolution as a core component of human knowledge. We ask that science remain science and that religion remain religion, two very different, but complementary, forms of truth.","Over 10,000 signatures of Christian Clergy have been collected, and have endorsed this letter."

GEN,0,GEN_notsarc_0095,"O.k., lets go through your scenario. The government has been toppled and the standing army has been crushed. Somehow all Americas nuclear arms were obliterated. The invading force has successfully instituted a dictatorship and is now systematically destroying our personal freedoms. Now suppose the year is 1799 and the population rises up. The five rounds with 200 million guns, works. The population overthroughs the invading army through sheer numbers, though the price is high in terms of casualties. America is once again free and the democratic system is once again put in place.The year is 2004, the population is no longer fit and tough from working in the fields to get their own food. But each of the 400 million people has a gun, with lets say 30 rounds each. The population now has 12 billion rounds, and lets assume each round is an armour piercing bullet with long range capabilities, and lets also assume for the hell of it, that each gun is a machine gun with long-range single shot abilities and a scope (just for fun). Same situation, same invading force. The population rises up, taking along with them the few remaining rockets and bombs from the few remaining weapons caches. Lets say 2 million hand-held anti-plane missiles, 4 million anti-tank missiles and for even more fun, lets say they have a genius military leader who has somehow the ability to maintain instant contact with any unit anywhere, and is the greatest tactical mind the planet has ever know.To overthrough the standing American army the invading force must have had massive numbers of planes, tanks and naval units. First off, 4 million anti-tank weapons is not much when put against 400 million people, so you have a lot of venerable areas. Where ever the militia units try to form, they are killed by tanks, even though many of the tanks with infantry backing are destroyed the army keeps going because to over through America who has the greatest tanks in the world, you would have to have like 10-1 ratio on the American armed divisions. But, wait. Lets assume somehow the ground forces of well-organized troops and tanks is defeated by the population. Lets assume the invading army again somehow lost all its ground units, lets pretend the enemy forces had exactly 4 million tanks, and the ratio of shot-to-kill was perfect. To defeat the American army of planes you would, again, have to have massive numbers (or technology superior planes). So the population tries shooting down the planes, but the planes would usually get away because modern planes can take out a ground-based target with out ever going closer the a couple miles. But again, wait. Somehow, without losing so many troops as not to be able to defeat the massive mechanized occupying force, all planes are spotted (miles away) and shoot down by the UNTRAINED militia. The genius military leaders (who no body though to kill) work no doubt. Yet still, the population is defeated because if I remember correctly, the militia doesn't have naval units. So even if all the inland forces could be killed, the majority of costal forces would be protected by barrages from the enemy naval force (which is very large because it had to defeat the American navy, the greatest in the world technologically).But lets assume, the population just swims to the invading ships, kills the crews, and uses the ships they stole to kill the other enemy ships. Thank god for that tactical genius at the helm of the American resistance. I am actually guessing that invading force must be like 20 times bigger then America's armies for one simple reason. The only way you could defeat the American ICBMs is to have a blitzkrieg (I know my spelling sucks) like attack. Most of the ICBM silos aren't connected to the internet, mainly because the government knows the silos would be venerable to internet attack, so any rebuttal involving the virus-like disabling of the nuclear stockpile is gone.Now, you may be wondering what am I trying to say here. Well its simple, if somehow, just somehow, the entire military force of the U.S. was obliterated, it would take just one ICBM hit on the enemy's capital city to make attack impossible. Again, the blitzkrieg like attack? Even if that worked the U.S., like Russia and a few other nuclear powers, keeps stockpiles of nuclear weapons hidden underground in the invent of being taken over, and the underground stockpiles usually have several rockets with enough range to blast the heck out of the closest invading army. So it would never happen that the U.S. would be left nuclear-naked.But lets assume that happened (maybe during a really, REALLY cool party some idiot colonel peed on them, and they just fried). The genius military commander did somehow take out the entire invading force of air, ground and sea. You still have to deal with the fact that whoever invaded the U.S. probably spend several trillion doing it ( I know, that's a pretty low number for the invasion of America), and in that case most likely have satellites and long-range missiles (again lets assume somehow America's own just fell out of the sky and the invading force got even guys together to be able to take out all America's nuclear silos including the underground stockpiles which each have own guard forces of soldiers training night and day for such an event). The hugest, most glaring problem with the militia, unless every one the 400 million militia units somehow got a radio and a laptop, they would have to gather. And if they gathered in the numbers they would need to gather in, to order to defeat the large invading army, they would be taken out very easily by 1. ICBMs launched from enemy subs 2. Prominent meetings between our military genius and his supporters stopped by snipers with a 1.5 mile range and superb training and intelligence (remember those satellites) 3. all groups preparing for ""battle"" so to speak could be taken out as they are marching or driving or whatever by mortars, ambushes, rockets, infantry rushes, tank columns etc. before they knew what hit them.4. It would take a lot of planning to get 400 million people to fight, and assuming everybody has a laptop with wireless capability, they would still need satellites for the military genius in California to command units in N.Y., N.Y., and....wait America's satellites are gone and if the invading force could do that, it wouldn't be that hard to take out commercial internet satellites in geoscyhronize orbit (effectively sitting ducks). And any land based networks would be destroyed in the first few hours of insurrection. --------------------------------------------------------------------------But militia units only have guns, and they would get their butts whooped, even with massive numbers. What you are saying is only true about Napoleonic tactics, in today's modern warfare almost completely infantry-based armies are obsolete and very venerable No the afghan war is not a valid counterpoint, the terrain was different, the people are more hardened, the weapons were supplied by a military power superior to the Russians, the afghans had unlimited anti-tank reserves, had incredibly extensive cave networks in which to hide, plan and attack, only had to defeat, on the majority, other infantry battalions because of the terrain in which armoured vehicles could not cross, the Russians were under funded and their moral low, the soviets had already been beaten down by large amounts of smaller fights across the cracking Soviet Empire, china needed to be supplied with more troops as it started to look toward independence, Afghanistan is nowhere near water eliminated the possibility of naval back-up by the very crappy Russian naval forces, the afghans received help from the rest of the Arab world which would not happen with the U.S. because if an enemy can take out the U.S., it could probably take out the combined forces of Europe and North America, and, finally, the afgans didn't have nukes so they had to defend themselves with their own two hands, but america has nukes and if ever anything tryed to do what is in the above senario they would get blasted because unlike the russians in afganhistan, the americans would be defended their homeland. Neither is the French revolution a good-counter point, as I have said, your tactics only work with Napoleonic-style battles and guess what kind of battle were happening when Napoleon the 3rd was in power? (in case you didn't learn it in school, Napoleon the 3rd, napoleon's nephew, was in power during the french revolution) Trust me, cause the only thing I love more then physics is military tactics and warfare. ----As I have shown in more detail, Treat2 is right, it wouldn't work.------The other amendments don't pertain to retaining the sovereignty of the U.S.A, they pertain to the basic rights each citizen enjoys and therefore will always be important and ""In Fashion"" so long as the U.S. still has human citizens.

Jack gets injured by Bob, and can no longer work unless he gets a $1000 operation. Jack's religion or other views preclude getting the operation, so he sues Bob for $200,000, the wages he'll lose over the next ten years.

GEN,0,GEN_notsarc_0320,"So, you think there is a God? Bad design does not equate to no design. It really is a poor argument.Much of the force of Darwin's arguments deal with bad design. I invite anyone to post any of Darwin's arguments that specifically outline his case against design because of ""bad"" design. That said, consider this, your car is said to operate at 25% fuel efficiency. One could claim then the car is 75% bad design, therefore it is not designed, and if it is, certainly not by anyone of any intelligence.Your audio CD's have Reed-Solomon error correction because the read/write process is full of errors that need correcting. Cleary this is ""bad design"" that engineers would create read/write heads that make so many errors in the first place. Same with modems and host of other devices. Clearly if in the remote chance these bad designs are evidence of design, the designers must be clueless!Poorly designed dramas have villains and heroes. Clearly a drama (even a divine drama) is poorly designed if it has villains in the story. All the characters should be Pollyanna and there should be no great tragedies on the road to a happy ending. Life and the Divine drama, like CD's and cars, are clearly not designed, or at least not designed by anyone with intelligence, because of all the bad design woven into the designs.The reason audio CD's have so many read/write errors which are corrected Reed-Solomon error correction (somewhat like us reading someone's writing and mentally correcting spelling and grammar errors) is that it is the most optimal way to get as much data on a CD as possible. The tightest packing of data implies the highest amount of errors based on the Shannon capacity theorem.The Mp3's and JPEGS are even more ""error"" prone in that they are inexact representations of the original sound or picture, but the goal was not fidelity but compactness.A similar consideration is for the 75% inefficiency for cars. The goal is for higher acceleration and agility and cost, etc., not fuel efficiency. The point is ""bad"" design, in the grand scheme of things, might not be bad design after all. The high rate of sickness and death, the eventual death of the universe as predicted by the 2nd law of thermodynamics are not evidences that the Designer is unwise, any more than the many errors in the read/write process of audio CD suggests the engineers of those devices are incompetent.Origin of Species Chapter 13:There is another and equally curious branch of the present subject; namely, the comparison not of the same part in different members of a class, but of the different parts or organs in the same individual. Most physiologists believe that the bones of the skull are homologous with that is correspond in number and in relative connexion with the elemental parts of a certain number of vertebrae. The anterior and posterior limbs in each member of the vertebrate and articulate classes are plainly homologous. We see the same law in comparing the wonderfully complex jaws and legs in crustaceans. It is familiar to almost every one, that in a flower the relative position of the sepals, petals, stamens, and pistils, as well as their intimate structure, are intelligible in the view that they consist of metamorphosed leaves, arranged in a spire. In monstrous plants, we often get direct evidence of the possibility of one organ being transformed into another; and we can actually see in embryonic crustaceans and in many other animals, and in flowers, that organs which when mature become extremely different, are at an early stage of growth exactly alike. How inexplicable are these facts on the ordinary view of creation! Why should the brain be enclosed in a box composed of such numerous and such extraordinarily shaped pieces of bone? As Owen has remarked, the benefit derived from the yielding of the separate pieces in the act of parturition of mammals, will by no means explain the same construction in the skulls of birds. Why should similar bones have been created in the formation of the wing and leg of a bat, used as they are for such totally different purposes? Why should one crustacean, which has an extremely complex mouth formed of many parts, consequently always have fewer legs; or conversely, those with many legs have simpler mouths? Why should the sepals, petals, stamens, and pistils in any individual flower, though fitted for such widely different purposes, be all constructed on the same pattern ? On the theory of natural selection, we can satisfactorily answer these questions.Homology was a pre-darwinian idea with the term coined by Owen who rather despised Darwin and his ideas.Darwin tries to argue why a Designer would not use the same for the same function. He says homology is evidence of an unwise design. The premise is a Creator wouldn't be so inefficient.But, unless one has a handle on the teleological goal, one is free to fabricate all manner of ""bad design"" arguments (for example read/write errors in audio CD's or fuel inefficient cars). The Biotic Message Theory suggest the teleological goal for biotic reality is to communicate to humans that there is one Designer and author of life, and that life could not have evolved. Like a great novel, the ""imperfections"" of biology are part of a larger plot.It is turning out, Darwin's argument from homology is a concept in crisis.","You are assuming that the TOE of evolution has remained static since Darwins time.I have to say that is false. We have 150 years of experimental data beyond that. In addition, we not only have the arguement from homology, but we have genetic data to back it up. So sorry, but you struck out."

If it shouldn't mean it, but it is used so that it does, then that's what it actually means.Creationism means religion, but it also involves a belief in the authenticity of historical documents that have been meticulously preserved over thousands of years. That's not just religion, it's secular, observed history - something evolution doesn't have. So if a person hearing your statement doesn't consider it carefully, it's very easy to be mislead by it. It implies that ""evolution"" (the branch that declares that the book of Genesis is false) is somehow a secular, observable truth - while creationism is nothing but a religion, a superstition. Since evolution can't prove the book of Genesis (ancient history) false, and creationism does have some historical backing, they are comparable and they directly conflict.The problem is, a school teacher can make the statement you made, and it can't be legally questioned by anyone. Yet there was a case that I read about somewhere, where a sticker was placed in science textbooks advising children to study evolution ""with an open mind"", and an ACLU lawsuit ensued. Of all those likely to be mislead by your statement, it's young impressionable school children. Publicly paid school teachers misleading them with statements like that, without a full explanation (prohibited by the courts) does get an establishment of atheism started. It's what I mean when I say that when church and state are separated, atheism and state are combined. Maybe government could be neutral, if it was small. The U.S. government is no longer small.

A week before that, the CIA fired missiles remotely from a Predator aircraft into the Waziristan tribal area. They were hoping to eradicate a bunch of al Qaeda operatives. Instead, they killed 18 women and children.One week before that, I arrived in Pakistan to visit Darra Adamkhel, the massive open-air market located deep in the tribal areas, where a frighteningly high percentage of Islamic holy warriors goes to buy their guns.Gaining access to the tribal areas was next to impossible. It took months of pre-planning with the consul general of Pakistan in Montreal and top officials in Peshawar. They repeatedly denied us entry because, according to them, the Pakistani Army had too many ""sensitive operations"" going on in that region. Without my personal advantage (a family friendship with the governor of the Northwest Frontier Province), we never would have gotten in.The government assigned me and my team a political agent named Naeem Afridi. He was born and raised in the tribal areas. He took care of us while we were there, and he was a godsend. You can't do anything in this part of the world without someone like Naeem.Our driver stopped at a security point just outside the town center, where we were introduced to the Frontier Agency militia, six angry-dad-looking guys with AKs and sidearms. They became our personal bodyguards, and followed us through the tight warren of gun shops and factories, barren little brick rooms where upward of 1,000 guns are manufactured every day. Most of the work is done by hand.The vendors are Pashtuns, who are basically the toughest people in the world. They comprised the majority of the mujahideen who kicked the Soviets out of Afghanistan in the late '80s.These days, the town is rumored to be completely overrun by the Taliban. They purchase the guns, then cross the border to fight the U.S. army in Afghanistan, or they drive through the mountains to the south to fight the Pakistani army.This summer, I went back to Pakistan, and found that the fuse on this powder keg has become even shorter. The Pakistani army has surged more troops into the tribal areas, attempting to eradicate the Taliban and al Qaeda. The U.S. and British troops are attempting to do the same thing on the other side of the border in Afghanistan. Meanwhile, Pakistan itself has seen violence spread to its major urban centers, where extremists have been detonating bombs and taking over police stations.But at the same time, there is a cultural explosion taking place, a vibrant art scene and metal and rock bands popping up everywhere. The whole situation has become ultra charged by the fact that there are tons of news channels operating uncensored by the insanely corrupt government.For Pakistan, it's a volatile, turbulent, and fascinating moment in time.","So...what was all that bull**** about terrorists exploiting America's ""weak gun control laws"" in order to amass arsenals of deadly weapons?It seems to me that they don't need undercover operatives to come to America, forge documents and undergo background checks just to get civilian weapons.

Alcohol however kills thousands of americans each year from alcohol poisoning. You know that idiot pothead. He didn't get dumb from pot, he got dumb from birth.

Tell them the short term and long term effects of each drug. If we can educate our kids and even adults through an ad campaign about what drugs do to you then we could save far more people.

In order to select or choose anything, an end must always be in view. There must always be a volitional discrimination of options based upon a criterion dictated by the desired end. The only time ""channel"" becomes teleological is when something live [a human or a beaver, let's say] intententionally does the channeling. But since it is understood that mechanical forces can also 'channel', unintentional, out of simple mechanics, the word channel cannot be called teleological. In the same way, 'sorting' can be considered non-teleological, hence mechanical, and thus suited to your glossary, because things can be sorted by mechanical forces alone. But 'selection' always requires volition and awareness. So 'selection' is always teleological."

GEN,0,GEN_notsarc_0549,"Court: Seattle police OK to stun pregnant womanBy GENE JOHNSON ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITERSEATTLE -- Three Seattle police officers were justified when they used a stun gun on a pregnant mother who refused to sign a traffic ticket, a federal appeals court ruled Friday in a case that prompted an incredulous dissent.Malaika Brooks was driving her son to Seattle's African American Academy in 2004 when she was stopped for doing 32 mph in a school zone. She insisted it was the car in front of her that was speeding, and refused to sign the ticket because she thought she'd be admitting guilt.Rather than give her the ticket and let her go on her way, the officers decided to arrest her. One reached in, turned off her car and dropped the keys on the floor. Brooks stiffened her arms against the steering wheel and told the officers she was pregnant, but refused to get out, even after they threatened to stun her.The officers - Sgt. Steven Daman, Officer Juan Ornelas and Officer Donald Jones - then stunned her three times, in the thigh, shoulder and neck, and hauled her out of the car, laying her face-down in the street.Brooks gave birth to a healthy baby two months later, but has permanent scars from the Taser. She sued the officers for violating her constitutional rights, and U.S. District Judge Richard Jones allowed the case to continue. He declined to grant the officers immunity for performing their official duties and said Brooks' rights were clearly violated.But in a 2-1 ruling Friday, a panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed. Judges Cynthia Holcomb Hall and Diarmuid F. O'Scannlain held that the officers were justified in making an arrest because Brooks was obstructing them and resisting arrest.The use of force was also justified because of the threat Brooks posed, Hall wrote: ""It seems clear that Brooks was not going to be able to harm anyone with her car at a moment's notice. Nonetheless, some threat she might retrieve the keys and drive off erratically remained, particularly given her refusal to leave the car and her state of agitation.""They also noted that the force used wasn't that serious because the Taser was in ""touch"" mode rather than ""dart"" mode, which hurts more. They reversed the lower court's opinion and held that the officers were entitled to immunity from the lawsuit.The officers' lawyers, Ted Buck and Karen Cobb, said the officers made the right decision under the circumstances they faced.""Police officers have to have the ability to compel people to obey their lawful orders,"" Buck said. That's all the court recognized today. The 9th Circuit just applied the law instead of getting caught up in the otherwise unfortunate factual circumstances.""The majority's opinion outraged Judge Marsha Berzon, who called it ""off the wall.""""I fail utterly to comprehend how my colleagues are able to conclude that it was objectively reasonable to use any force against Brooks, let alone three activations of a Taser, in response to such a trivial offense,"" she wrote.She argued that under Washington law, the officers had no authority to take Brooks into custody: Failure to sign a traffic infraction is not an arrestable offense, and it's not illegal to resist an unlawful arrest.Berzon said the majority's notion that Brooks obstructed officers was so far-fetched that even the officers themselves didn't make that legal argument. To obstruct an officer, one must obstruct the officer's official duties, and the officers' only duties in this case were to detain Brooks long enough to identify her, check for warrants, write up the citation and give it to her. Brooks' failure to sign did not interfere with those duties, she said.Furthermore, Brooks posed no apparent threat, and the officers could not have known how stunning her would affect the fetus, or whether it might prompt premature labor - another reason their actions were inexcusable, Berzon said.Brooks' lawyer, Eric Zubel, said he would ask the 9th Circuit to rehear the case.""This is outrageous - that something like this could happen to a pregnant woman, in front of an elementary school, at 8:30 in the morning, to someone who posed no threat whatsoever,"" he said.","For anti-choicers, it's just about control and power over women. They don't care about life. (Except their own.)This same mother could be a person who didn't have access to pre-natal care. They wouldn't defend that right either.Because they DON'T care about the fetus. They don't care about life. They don't care about health. They care about power and money and pushing people around. That's all."

Secularism is not a worldview in itself, it is a policy of how to apply religious and other worldview in real life.Secularism does not exclude people with a religious worldview. One may imagine a devout christian that firmly believes in his faith, but is also convinced that faith must come from within and that forcing someone to behave in accordance with a religion simply encourages false faith, and would logically conclude that his faith should not be forced upon people (usually with the subclause of ""Let them burn in hell afterwards"", or something else along those lines).","So if an atheist believes that humans are the highest form of intelligence, and a devout Christian believes God is the highest form of intelligence, the Christian should allow the atheist to force him to behave as if humans are the highest form of intelligence?"

Yet theistic evolutionists are comfortable to (usually politically) be ""with"" agnostics and atheists, and separate themselves from creationists. If they're genuine Christians, knowing about the warnings in the Bible about false teachings, how can they be comfortable with that?Miller laments in several places throughout the book that atheists use evolution as a weapon against religion, and that it shouldn't be that way - that it causes more strife between the two than should exist.

But early birds had fingered claws on those wings. It is generally true that no organ ever springs into existance completely developed where nothing existed before. The wings of bats, birds, and pterodactyls are merely the modified fore-limb of a tetrapod. There is evidence that insect wings may have arisen from some sort of thermal panel. And of course, size has considerable relevance to flight. Wingless spiders fly by spinning a loop of silk that is carried by the moving air. Very small insects require almost no wings to fly. What they do is more similar to a whale in water than a bird in air. If by chance, a small animal is upsized because of a competetive advantage, and the wings are too, then it becomes a larger flying animal."

GEN,0,GEN_notsarc_0562,"Hi SS. Causing trouble again? :)The cat experiment you describe cannot, unfortunately, be used to support Lamarckian inheritance, because all the animals were denied the same essential nutrients, both the parents and the developing cats in the womb. Logically, if lack of nourishment causes health problems in one generation it's inevitably going to cause the same problems in the next even without any evolution taking place. As others have pointed out, this experiment is evidence that adaptation to that restricted diet was not happening. Had the cats initially suffered and then begun to get better, this would be strong evidence that adaptation was occurring.Similarly, if you were denied Vitamin C you would develop scurvy. If a pregnant woman was denied Vitamin C - well, it hardly bears thinking about, but the fact the baby - were it to survive at all - would undoubtedly also suffer from scurvy is readily explicable by the observation that it, too, was denied Vitamin C.Now, if the baby was born with a functional Vitamin C synthesising gene, that would be compelling evidence that organisms could intelligently respond to environmental changes.",Well I'm not arguing that this is adaptation...I have never said that.. What I am saying is the environment -- in this case diet is the cause for these traits to emerge in offspring.....but like I said earlier ToE does not admit that the diet or any enviornmental variable can influence traits in offspring. Traits are dictated by genes and genes are closed off from the enviornment. This is the basic dogma of Weismann's barrier. I'm not necessarily calling this evolution....I'm just simply pointing out that acquired traits can be inherited. There is no other way to describe this other than Lamarckism. Do you disagree that The inheritance of acquired characteristics is simply changes in physiology acquired over the life of an organism that are transmitted to offspring?

In the book, a high level official of this society mentions to the main character that an experiment had been tried in which all the people made were brilliant, athletic and beautiful - anyway, characteristics that we admire in people (nothing was said about picking their moral character). They ended up killing each other in competition for the better jobs and for leadership since nobody was willing to play the subservient menial role.

Basically what I'm trying to say is something like the foetus being developed enough to feel pain would not change the mind of a woman who had just found out she was pregnant and she'd been raped, or was going through something you can't understand. For an abortion that late she'd have to deliver the foetus anyway, which is traumatising enough. "

""There's no second chance."" Previously, Green says, molecular biologists thought the ribosome tightly managed its actions only prior to the actual incorporation of the next building block by being super-selective about which chemical ingredients it allows to enter the process.Because a protein's chemical ""shape"" dictates its function, mistakes in translating assembly codes can be toxic to cells, resulting in the misfolding of proteins often associated with neurodegenerative conditions. Working with bacterial ribosomes, Green and her team watched them react to lab-induced chemical errors and were surprised to see that the protein-manufacturing process didn't proceed as usual, getting past the error and continuing its ""walk"" along the DNA's protein-encoding genetic messages.""We thought that once the mistake was made, it would have just gone on to make the next bond and the next,"" Green says. ""But instead, we noticed that one mistake on the ribosomal assembly line begets another, and it's this compounding of errors that leads to the partially finished protein being tossed into the cellular trash,"" she adds.","So what is being monitored by the ribosome? Information. Material representations (amino acid sequence vs DNA sequence) of information. But, it does not only monitor it, it manipulates it as a means to an end... fidelity."

GEN,0,GEN_notsarc_0752,"asahi.com????????Unloaded rifle on TV triggers controversy - EnglishOTSU, Shiga Prefecture--Given this nation's strict gun control law, were police overreacting when they swooped on a TV broadcaster that had allowed a celebrity to handle a hunting rifle during a live broadcast?The Shiga prefectural police insist they were perfectly within their rights, but TV networks are outraged, citing the fact the weapon was not loaded.The incident stems from a show aired Jan. 17 by Biwako Broadcasting Co. Almost four months later, police mounted a search of the premises and confiscated a dozen items, including a script and a DVD of the show.Critics accuse the police of being overzealous and question their motives, but law enforcement officials remain unrepentant.Shiga prefectural police regard the incident, in which a hunter with a gun permit allowed TV personality Noburo Harada, 57, to momentarily handle the rifle during the show, as a serious breach of a law concerning the storage and management of firearms.So much so, in fact, that on June 12, the prefectural police referred the case to prosecutors. As a result, the hunter, aged 49, along with a 60-year-old TV producer and a 37-year-old director of the show, could face charges of violating the swords and firearms control law.Police did not pursue a case against Harada even though he briefly handled the weapon. Police argued that he did not actually ""possess"" the rifle because the hunter handed it to him in an unscripted moment during the broadcast.Police justified their search on grounds that they needed to determine if the law concerning the storage and management of firearms had been broken.The show, called ""Tokimeki Shiga'S,"" is broadcast one Saturday a month. In the show, Harada visits various locations in the prefecture as a travel guide.The program in question was set in Yogo, where Harada and other cast members were served a pot of wild boar meat. The hunter who had killed the boar appeared in the scene. He offered the unloaded weapon to Harada and asked,""Do you want to hold it?""Harada held the rifle and commented, ""It's heavy, isn't it?"" adding, ""Not everybody has a chance to hold it, right?""He held the firearm for six seconds and then gave it back.Biwako Broadcasting says the scene in which the hunter handed over the rifle was not in the script and was improvised.The TV crew decided to display the rifle on the show after the hunter told the director he had no problem with the idea at a preliminary meeting.The prefectural police began their investigation after a complaint by a viewer.The intervention by the police flabbergasted Harada and employees of other TV stations.""I never could have imagined anything like this,"" Harada, a former member of the male comedy duo Anonenone, told reporters after he was questioned by police on June 2. ""I was stunned.""Akihiko Ito, head of the TV station's programming department, said the station would cooperate with police, but defended Harada's actions.""We consulted our lawyers, and it is hard to believe that touching a rifle for about six seconds is equivalent to possessing it,"" he said.A spokesperson with a TV station based in Osaka sharply criticized police.""They should have at least asked (Biwako Broadcasting) to cooperate voluntarily,"" a spokesperson said. ""From a common sense standpoint, we cannot even comprehend what the police were thinking.""An employee at another TV station was also critical.""If we, for example, were to produce a program about a knife shop and an actor picked up a large knife, would the police investigate us, too?"" the employee asked. ""Such an overreaction would be intimidating toward people trying to do their jobs. This would ultimately undermine viewer interest in programming.""But police say they don't understand what all the fuss is about. They say the media has, by focusing on the celebrity angle, blurred the facts in the case.A senior official with the Shiga prefectural police said the real issue is not that Harada briefly held the rifle, but whether bringing the rifle to the live broadcast was appropriate in terms of ""storage and management.""An explanation for the police tactics may lie in the revised gun control law, which took effect in January.The law was tightened after a 37-year-old man in Sasebo, Nagasaki Prefecture, shot and killed two people and wounded six in December 2007. The man, known for erratic behavior, committed suicide after the shooting.The incident called into question whether existing regulations regarding gun permits and firearm storage were adequate.""I believe the hunter who handed the rifle to the actor and the TV crew lacked an awareness of the firearm's potential danger,"" another police official said.According to the National Police Agency, police can file a case against anybody if he or she, with criminal intent to kill or injure people, possesses a weapon for even a second.A case can be built based not on the length of time of possession, but on the purpose of possession, the presence of criminal intent and whether the suspect tricked or maneuvered the gun owner.The Shiga prefectural police justify the raid on the grounds that they had to find out how it was possible to bring a gun to the show.By transporting the gun to the show, the hunter may have violated the rules under which he was granted a gun permit, police asserted.They defended questioning Harada and the crew as crucial to ferreting out the real issue--did those involved in the program improperly store and manage the weapon?Takaaki Hattori, professor of media law at Rikkyo University in Tokyo, says that police went too far.""The way the police conducted their investigation is not convincing. I sense they were trying to use the media to sell the public on the revised gun control law,"" he said. ""They should have been more cautious about the exercise of power by public authorities.""But he also said the broadcaster could have been more prudent.""The TV station should consider whether it was absolutely necessary to use a gun in making the show. The gun owner may have been primarily responsible, but the broadcaster is also to blame for lacking awareness of the law.""Takaaki Matsumiya, professor of criminal law at Ritsumeikan University School of Law in Kyoto, disagrees that the TV station or the hunter were in any way culpable and lays the blame on the authorities.Citing a precedent set by the Tokyo High Court in June 1967, he said: ""The high court decided that the act of touching a handgun for dozens of seconds by a man brokering the sale of a handgun during the transfer did not constitute 'possession,'"" he said. ""There have been no precedents to alter that interpretation. Harada did not 'possess' it (during the show).""Matsumiya also defended the hunter who brought the rifle to the set.""When the precedent concludes that a person 'has no legitimate reason' for bearing and carrying a firearm, it assumes that he or she was going to do harm or ran a risk of doing harm,"" he said. ""It is obvious that was not the case under these circumstances.""(IHT/Asahi: July 2,2009)Now then, what's all this bull**** about how other industrialized nations are better off with regard to guns when compared to America? I don't see such being the case, do you?

""Three generations of imbeciles are enough,"" he famously wrote in his ruling in Buck v. Bell, which affirmed the constitutionality of forced sterilization of people deemed genetically inferior. . . . in the mid-1800's . . . the British polymath Sir Francis Galton . . . introduced the idea of intelligence as an inherited trait and . . . developed a science to promote it, which he named eugenics. In America, Galton's ideas were picked up by the biologist Charles Davenport, who in 1904 established Cold Spring Harbor laboratory on Long Island as a national center for eugenics research and policy planning. . . . Davenport created a Eugenics Records Office and recruited an ambitious young high school teacher named Harry Laughlin to join him in an enormous project that sent fieldworkers across the country to identify the ""germ-plasm"" of unfit family strains so that it could be eradicated. Laughlin became an influential developer of American compulsory sterilization policy, which had officially begun in 1907 when Indiana passed a law allowing scientists to use surgical methods to eradicate the unfit . . . .He helped Congress formulate the 1924 Immigration Act, which kept out ""inferior"" people from Southern and Eastern Europe. Bruinius deftly plays up the contrast between the eugenicists' obsession with cold measurements of human value and their own messy lives, which were marked by disease and behavior that could have qualified them as unfit: Galton suffered from severe depression; Davenport had one child who was sickly and another who was apparently dyslexic; and Laughlin was afflicted with epilepsy. In America and elsewhere, enthusiasm for eugenics was broadly supported by elites. In Britain, people as varied as Winston Churchill and George Bernard Shaw embraced its goals, and there was lively debate about how much the state itself should control reproduction of individuals. Eugenic science especially appealed to Fabian socialists, who saw it as further justification for abolishing class — after all, once the playing field was level the effect of heredity could finally express itself clearly and be studied. In this country, eugenic theory and practice engaged the likes of Theodore Roosevelt, the birth control crusader Margaret Sanger and leaders of the Carnegie and Rockefeller foundations.

One study was able to identify 3 common SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) in the coding region of the gene, 2 of which result in small changes in enzyme function in European populations. The third SNP converts that locus to a stop codon and results in an enzyme that is 447 amino acids long. Thus, the enzyme has been truncated. The resulting enzyme, LPL S447X, is functional.

GEN,0,GEN_notsarc_0961,"To apathy:Call me crazy, but I still don't see any evolution in the peppered moths!! We had light and dark moths before the industrial revolution, we now still have light and dark moths. The only thing that has changed is the population ratio, assumably by *natural selection*. Natural selection is not proof of evolution by any means. Creationists recognise it and accept it as it goes in nicely with the creationary model. Natural selection is basically the death of a particular type of animal if they are unsuited to the environment. In a given environment (e.g. a very cold region), some (e.g. the long-haired dogs) will be more likely to survive, and so pass on their information, than others. Natural selection can favour some sets of information above others, and can eliminate some of the existing information in the population, but it can't create any new information. An example, consider the cold environment mentioned above. We take a population of both long, short and medium, haired dogs to this environment. Over time, very short time, the population will only consist of the long haired dogs as the short and medium haired dogs would freeze and be wiped out by the cold conditions. So, as a result, the population as a whole has lost the information for making short haired dogs and has not gained any new information. What did we have when we first took the dogs to the environment? Dogs (varying in hair sizes). What did we get after a short amount of time? Dogs (only the long hair size). There is no evolution occuring here, we had dogs before, dogs after. The only difference is that the gene for making short hair has been eradicated from the population by natural selection -- that is it. This is the essense of natural selection - and goes in nicely with the Biblical account of our origins, i.e. variation within a kind and that kind's have the ability to only lose information - not gain it.So even if the peppered moth case was really true, and not a fraud, it still would not be evidence for evolution as opposed to creation. Anyone who says other wise, does not really know what they are talking about unless new genetic information is somehow being added to the moth's total DNA content, i.e. their genome, in which case you might have a point.Would any creationists like to challenge anything about this article or the concept? His method appears to be good, i.e. using observations and experimental data, as well as repeatability. He is using the scientific method (in reverse as he is collecting the observations and experimental data and then will draw a conclusion based on the evidence and possibly his own bias. This is yet to be determined, however. Can you keep us informed of his progress?","Also another example put forward is a bacteria that can only sustain itself by eating Nylon. The theory goes - nylon is a recent invention therefore this bacteria must have eolved recently.What it suggests however is that a portion of an existing population would have died if not for nylon... the bug has to have nylon, or it will die.It is akin to looking at a portion of the human population who would die from heart-trouble.

Those who hold this as an absolute belief must extend the right of a woman's right to choose the allocation of her bodily resources beyond pregnancy and into every instance of life. Therefore the pro-choice line of reasoning that says that a woman has the right to choose to abort because she does not wish do share her bodily resources can be extended to conclude also that a newborn infant can be aborted if a woman decides not to donate her bodily resource of nutrition and she has no access to formula (no other factors involved).","That is an erroneous line of reasoning because it fails to take into account the myriad of other options open to a women after birth to remove the newborn from her care without any ill effects (physically anyway). Killing in the instance of a newborn is not justified because of those other options open to her. By contrast, a pregnant woman has exactly one option open to her to remove the fetus from her care and that is abortion. I would contend that the same line of reasoning that allows for adoption can be used here, that no one must donate their resources to a dependant.Your reasoning that a woman, using the same line of reasoning that pro-choice people employ, can withhold her bodily resources ""until the newborn dies"" as if that is equal to withholding bodily resources in pregnancy is faulty."

GEN,0,GEN_notsarc_1002,"Another view of this nylon-eating-bug is given...""Finally, Mr Cerutti is out of date about this new nylon digesting ability allegedly from a frame shift. New evidence shows that the ability was due to plasmids [e.g. K. Kato, et al., ?A plasmid encoding enzymes for nylon oligomer degradation: Nucleotide sequence analysis of pOAD2?, Microbiology (Reading) 141(10):2585?2590, 1995.] In fact, more than one species of bacteria have the ability, residing on plasmids. This suggests that the information probably already existed, and was just passed between different types of bacteria."" ""All that would be needed to enable an enzyme to digest nylon is a mutation causing loss of specificity in a proteolytic (protein-degrading) enzyme. This may seem surprising? How would a loss of information create a new ability? Answer: enzymes are usually tuned very precisely to only one type of molecule (the substrate). Loss of information would reduce the effectiveness of its primary function, but would enable it to degrade other substrates, too. Since both nylon and proteins are broken down by breaking amide linkages, a change in a proteolytic enzyme could also allow it to work on nylon. If this process were continued, the result would be a general enzyme with a weakly catalytic effect on the hydrolysis of too many chemicals to be useful where much selectivity is required. To put it into perspective, acids and alkalis also catalyze many hydrolysis reactions, but they also lack specificity. Indeed, an inhibitor of a protein degrading enzyme also inhibits the action of the nylon degrading enzyme""http://www.answersingenesis.org/home...e7-24-2000.aspTalkorigins gave their usual doubletalk""Whilst this particular case does not ""prove"" evolution, it is consistent with, and supportive of, the theory of biological evolution.""Why do they say this? Because it's still a bacteria. It's not like it suddenly became a large multi-cellular organism. But it might just prove that this bug was so well designed that it can cope with newer situations. One site does say that it, the bacteria, had the capability already within it of change ? not resultant in ?mutations?, but more like switching on previously dormant apparatus. http://members.tripod.com/aslodge/id89.htmOne poster on another forum summed the problem up like this..."" In order for species to advance there would have to be a net information gain, which isn't the case with nylon eating bacteria.The bacteria gained the ability to digest nylon, therefore was able to survive in a new environment. Two distinct advantagesBut, the bacteria lost its ability to survive in its old environment, eat its former diet and suffered a 98% loss in efficiency. Three disadvantages.So by taking two steps forward and three steps backward, where is the net gain?

GEN,0,GEN_notsarc_1101,"Your reasoning would be applicable if only one copy of the gene in question ever existed.If the chance of mutation A happening is one in a billion, and the chance of mutation B happening is also one in a billion, then the chance of them both happening together to a single gene is, as you say, beyond the realms of possibility at 1 in 1,000,000,000,000,000,000.However, we're not talking about a single gene. A population of a billion bacteria is nothing unusual, and all of them will contain the same gene. So while the odds of any individual experiencing mutation A are very low, the odds of one of them experiencing it are pretty high. The lottery works on the same principle. You probably won't win, but someone probably will.Ok, so now we have our billion bacteria, one of which possesses mutation A. However, the odds of mutation B stacking with it are still only 1 in 1,000,000,000.Now, if mutation A isn't particularly helpful, that's probably the end of the story. But if mutation A is helpful, then that bacterium will outcompete its peers for resources, and breed more readily than they do - either better in absolute terms, or better in immediate proximity, when in competition for the same resources. Either way, the proportion of the population possessing mutation A will increase until they predominate. Now there isn't just one copy of the A-mutant gene in circulation, there are about a billion, and the odds of mutation B stacking with just one of them are greatly improved. Once again, if mutation B is helpful the descendents of that bacterium will flourish and overrun the population, so that in a relatively short time (a few hundred bacterial generations) a single cell possessing neither mutation can give rise to a population of a billion all possessing not one but two billion-to-one mutations - a population ready for the next billion-to-one mutation to occur, and stack, and flourish, and so on.I hope that helps.","Well this is what i am saying. The probability of a and b in one organism i very low. And the probability of A and B in many generations is lower than just A. This is what Behe deals with in his book. One reason evolution of primates interest me more than bacteria is the the number of organisms and generations is much much lower, and the changes involved must be pretty big. It involves Real evolution as opposed to stuff like antibiotic resistance or sicke cell haemoglobin that i see more as a reversable adaption, not a developement to a permanently better/more complex state.

I have been patiently waiting for many years but to date have never seen or heard of any species morphing into another species. I am aware of genetic defects that limit species but unaware of mutations that perpetuate new species. Clearly variation within species is possible and has been observed, such as poodles and great danes, but they remain members of the same species.Mankind has thousands of years of written history and I am unaware of anyone observing species morphation(Is that a word?). Although it is approaching 200 years after Darwin hypothesised how species might have originated, we are no closer to observing a species morphing than Darwin. Humans attempt to create new species, such as breeding donkey with horses to get mules and lions with tigers to get ligers, but these ""NEW"" species are almost always born sterile and unable to perpetuate themselves.

If some electrons see other electrons coming at them down a wire they will also move down the wire to avoid them. If it means going through a circuit an powering a light globe to do the electrons will still flow if the circuit is complete. Now lets think about whats happening, each indivual electron hates large group of electrons coming towards it but to get out of the way it will have to get closer to other electrons (those punks). So if you increased the cross sectional area of the wire then the resistance will decrease. What about a double adaptor? All it does is let the current go through two different circuits. Now if there are two light globes will they both glow half as bright? No. Why because the resistance is halved and there will be twice as much total electron flow.

Rights Retained by the PeopleAside from contending that a bill of rights was unnecessary, the Federalists responded to those opposing ratification of the Constitution because of the lack of a declaration of fundamental rights by arguing that inasmuch as it would be impossible to list all rights it would be dangerous to list some because there would be those who would seize on the absence of the omitted rights to assert that government was unrestrained as to those. 1 Madison adverted to this argument in presenting his proposed amendments to the House of Representatives. ''It has been objected also against a bill of rights, that, by enumerating particular exceptions to the grant of power, it would disparage those rights which were not placed in that enumeration; and it might follow by implication, that those rights which were not singled out, were intended to be assigned into the hands of the General Government, and were consequently insecure. This is one of the most plausible arguments I have ever heard against the admission of a bill of rights into this system; but, I conceive, that it may be guarded against. I have attempted it, as gentlemen may see by turning to the last clause of the fourth resolution.'' 2 It is clear from its text and from Madison's statement that the Amendment states but a rule of construction, making clear that a Bill of Rights might not by implication be taken to increase the powers of the national government in areas not enumerated, and that it does not contain within itself any guarantee of a right or a proscription of an infringement. 3 Recently, however, the Amendment has been construed to be positive affirmation of the existence of rights which are not enumerated but which are nonetheless protected by other provisions.",The purpose of the Bill of Rights.

GEN,0,GEN_notsarc_1277,"For obvious reasons we Christians have always been adamant supporters of civil liberties when it comes to freedom of religion. We have even managed to be consistent in this principle by not opposing the rights of Buddhists, New Agers, or even Satanists to meet, because we realize that to do so would equally undercut our own right to assemble. Perhaps the thought of undermining religious freedom sends through our minds flashes of those days when the Emperor Nero used to ignite Christians as human torches to light the streets of Rome at night. The persecutions against the early church have ingrained into our Christian consciousness the incredible value of living under a government that protects the interests of religion.But in the case of civil same-sex marriage, instead of recognizing the civil rights issue at stake here, we oppose the idea, quoting Bible verses and appealing to morals, nature, tradition, history, and the fear that Western civilization as we know it will come crashing to the ground. All of these arguments are related, of course. They are an appeal to that part of American society in which Judeo-Christian values are still deeply rooted. For even in America at the dawning of the 21st century, many people's understanding of morality and nature still reflect the vestiges of the Western Christendom of our heritage, as do their ideas of tradition, history and an ideal society.We do not, however, argue against civil same-sex marriage in the spirit of calm persuasion. There is desperation in our tone. There is also a great deal of fear and mean-spiritedness in our rhetoric, to the point where we even accuse homosexuals (without much proof, I might add) of being child molesters and sexual predators, and of seeking to corrupt our youth by recruiting them into their ""lifestyle.""There are probably many people who think they are justified in having such fears, but it seems to me it is more than just paranoia that feeds our frenzy.

GEN,0,GEN_notsarc_1292,"This post contains a perfectly simple explanation of why ToE is a sham along with a challenge to any Darwinist to prove me wrong.ToE is constructed on a fraud premise. This premise says that the fundamental unit of evolution is the gene. Whenever an evolutionist talks about “evolution” he's not talking about mere phenotypic change – he's talking about changes in genes. To a Darwinist, just because an animal changes phentoypically, or even if he passes these changes down to progeny does not mean that “evolution” has occurred. A fish could morph into a human, but if there are no changes in genes then this would not be considered ""evolution."" The only way evolution can happen, by their own definition, is if there is a change in genetics. This premise, I suggest is a complete and total fraud...and I will explain why now:Let's take humans and dogs, for example. When compared side-by-side, sure enough, humans may have an assortment of genes that dogs do not – and possibly the other way around. But just because humans may have certain genes that dogs don't, does not mean that these genes cause the difference between humans and dogs. Of course, there are no “dog genes” or “human genes.” But likewise there are no “tongue genes,” “tail genes” or “toenail genes.” Parts are not translated genes. Thus, the assertion that new genes got created or that individual genes mutated over time to chnage one kind of animal into another is blatantly false and physically impossible.But it's worse than that.As I said before, humans have a whole slew of genes – theoretically, at least -- that dogs (or other animals) don't have. But evolutionists still contend that these genetic differences cause the difference between the organisms! That's why they analyze DNA with such scrutiny! But did it ever dawn on them that studying genetics is a compete waste of time because of the real possibility that each dog or each human has the genes they have because of what they are? Scientists have been telling us for decades that who or what we are is determined by what genes we have...But they've got it backwards! Instead, we have the genes we have because of who we are. A dog isn't a dog because he barks; a dog barks because of what he is. Same with genes.This, of course, spells destructin to ToE because it means genetic evolution is a fraud. Evolution, thus, should not be a theory based on changes in genes, but a theory based on changes in traits.But scientists continue to mess around with genes and try to make the body do weird things by mutating them. They simply won't give up because they've seen correlations between gene activity and various physiological responses.But here's where they're screwing everything up:When you were a kid did you ever stand on your head? If so, did your face ever get red if you stayed upside down for a period of time? If so, do you admit that it was the act of being upside down that caused the blood to rush to your head? Or, do you have the audacity to claim that you were upside down because your face was red? That's excactly what science is doing with genetics: they've got the audacity to claim that changes in genes (the red face) is causing the organsim to change physiologically (go upside down.) In reality, what's happening is the organism is experiencing a new environment (turning upside down) and then the genes are responding in kind (turning red).The only way you can prove this logic wrong is to do one of two things:1) show me conclusively that mutations happen completely randomly and unoriented to environmental pressures. 2) show me that the same environmental pressures on genes will not produce the exact same physiological effects over and over and over.So there it is. Go for it.",So what this guy is saying is that he believes in natural selection but not evolution?

That means, in principle, IC systems can evolve. If you don't believe so, bring forth the I.C. system of your choice.   To say 'But you don't know all the answers' is just the logical fallacy known as 'argument from ignorance'.

""My faith,"" he said, has always been--then he used the most interesting word--""complete."" But he had taken sufficient offence already, it seemed, that I pressed no further. I wish sometimes that I'd asked: If your faith was ""always complete,"" did the archaeological evidence make it ""more complete""?

Scientific discovery, evidence, and discourse thus don't ""disprove the Bible."" Rather, they serve to displace interpretations of biblical text, and give us cause--I call it: opportunity--to find new, richer meaning in scripture. I'm often embarrassed by the smallness and brittleness of certain Christians' interpretations. Emphasizing the 'literal,' as some do--a very problematic term in itself--some Christians see in, for example, the Genesis ""tree of the knowledge of good and evil"" nothing more than a tree. A biological tree. Pear tree. Peach tree. Apple tree. Tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Albeit a special species, nonetheless a species. And, for them, there you go--Eve chowed down on the fruit of a proscribed species, and that's your story. Lost, in the insistence upon and closing of that interpretation, is the richness of metaphor the story offers. Metaphor, again and again, is variously deliberately denigrated or unconsciously eclipsed, in the readings of certain Christians.Science is not the only victim of such cheesily 'literal' interpretation. Christian faith--at least, the possibility of a rich faith robustly aware of its own weight in metaphor, parable, legend and myth, and the transformative power that arises from those aspects of scripture--is equally victim. I feel more sadness about such a limited believer's faith than I do about that person's science.Master_Shake, for your poignantly apt remark--""what they have isn't faith at all""--thanks.

No one can deny that after a human being is conceived it will develop into the very same being as those debating this issue. What astounds me is that those who favor abortion went through an identical development stage as the being they are condemning to death. Would these very same people agree that a similiar choice should have been made about their own existence? Abortion today is used primarily as a birth control of convenience because people are too self-centered to take precautions. They prefer their own pleasurable self-indulgence over the care and sanctity of the life they created. What ever happened to taking responsibility for one's actions in this country? Is it too much to ask a woman who has conceived to place the child into adoption? Nine months of discomfort is nothing compared to life in prison for voluntary manslaughter! Does the father of the child have a say in this? And what about the constitution of the United States? Are not all people conceived in this country deserving of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness? I believe abortion is a crime against humanity and should be outlawed. We need to overturn the Roe v. Wade decision and get back to cherishing life in this country. For a country that murders it's children cannot be far from self destruction.","You have some good points here, but what do you do in the event of pregnancy due to rape?

An example is the Tony Martin case:Tony Martin was a farmer, whose remote farmhouse had been broken in to many times. Martin feared future burglary attempts and the risk of being attacked by a violent burglar. When a pair of burglars broke in while he was home, Martin opened fire with a pump action shotgun. The 16-year-old burglar Fred Barras was killed, and 33-year-old Brendon Fearon was wounded in the leg. Later on that day, the police arrested Tony Martin and charged him with the crimes of murder and wounding with intent. At trial, Martin argued that he had acted in self defense, but the court found that he had fired while they were trying to flee. He was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison, although the conviction was later reduced to manslaughter with a 5 year sentence. The surviving criminal, who had over 30 criminal convictions, then sued Tony Martin for the injury he suffered during the burglary. The parole board refused to grant Tony Martin an early release because he “has shown no remorse and would continue to pose a danger to any other burglars.” Martin was eventually released from prison after spending years in prison and being vilified by the anti-gun groups in the UK for shooting criminals who had broken into his home.Another example, from 2009, also shows how the British legal system favors criminals over their victims:A millionaire businessman has been jailed for attacking a man who held his family hostage in their own home – while the criminal went free. Munir Hussain, who was threatened at knifepoint and tied up by a gang of masked men in his living room last year, was told he must go to prison for 30 months to preserve “civilised society”. But Walid Salem, a criminal with more than 50 convictions, was handed a two-year supervision order for his role in the break-in at an earlier hearing. He was one of three men who ambushed Mr Hussain, his wife and children as they returned to their home in High Wycombe, Bucks, on Sept 3 last year after attending Ramadan prayers at their local mosque, Reading Crown Court heard. Their hands were tied behind their backs and they were forced to crawl from room to room before being forced to lie down in the living room. But when Hussain's teenage son managed to escape and raise the alarm, he seized his chance and turned on his captors. . . The brothers were found guilty of causing grievous bodily harm with intent by a jury in September. Sentencing, Judge John Reddihough told them it was his “public duty” to jailing Munir Hussain for 30 months and his brother for 39 months.This one is quite nice as wellCleared: Builder who chopped off thug's ear with Samurai sword after he threatened to rape and kill his family | Mail OnlineWell thank god for the gun ban in england.

That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.More specifically, in democracies, these fundamental or inalienable rights include freedom of speech and expression, freedom of religion and conscience, freedom of assembly, and the right to equal protection before the law. This is by no means an exhaustive list of the rights that citizens enjoy in a democracy, but it does constitute a set of the irreducible core rights that any democratic government worthy of the name must uphold.

Inflation affects the price of everything on this planet.","Nice try, but no cigar. I never said that inflation had no effect. Of course it does. But even factoring in the alleged 500% inflation since the 1960s or whatever it happens to be depending on calculation does not account for the huge run-up in the price of crude to nearly $80 not that long ago.

Why not answer it?I see a pattern here Archie. If someone asks you a tough question about your faith, you cry ""Corrupter! Blasphemer!"" and run away. Is this your idea of ""witnessing""? Is your faith that weak? Answer my simple little question, then I will answer the same one, or another of your choosing if you'd like. Tit for tat."

To suggest it is never right to use violence is simply not true.,"Spanking doesn't teach children to defend themselves against violence. It teaches them the exact opposite because they are forced to submit to these acts of violence *and* they are told it's being done out of love. Do you ever wonder what conditions some women and men to accept violence from their partner? Do you ever wonder how they could not recognize it as abuse? I'll give you three guesses.

The case is not novel, and my sense is that the defense is generally recognized: Just as what would otherwise be the crime of murder, attempted murder, battery, and the like might be justified if done in defense against an imminent threat, so a felon’s taking possession of a gun is justified if done in defense against an imminent threat. (The defense does not apply to a felon’s arming himself against a possible threat of attack at some indefinite future time.) Still, the case struck me as an interesting illustration.

An official from the ""United Arab Emirates"" was with him, that was Clinton's excuse for not doing it. What did he think they were doing, making cookies, or did it dawn on him that they may have been up to no good?Thanks a lot, William Jefferson Clinton!"

RQ,0,RQ_notsarc_0115,The upheaval due to movement in oceanic and continental plates currently outpaces the rate of erosion. This is know and quantifiable given that all branches of sciences and all current forms of dating back it up.,So have you found figures pertaining to the rate of mountain growth? It is not enough to see with the naked eye the way erosion is. This explanation would also cause some mountains to fall as tectonic plates move away from eachother. Again after billions of years all rivers in existence would be deeper than those in the grand canyon without the material coming down from mountains.
RQ,0,RQ_notsarc_0116,"Nope, your argument fails again. Nothing in the Heller ruling suggests that gun rationing laws are constitutional in nature. At best Heller was simply saying that the individual rights nature of the Second Amendment doesn't automatically rule all gun control null and void. But then again nobody was really expecting it to. The details of what is allowable and what isn't haven't been hammered out yet. But I would love to see you try and explain how 30 months in prison, a felony conviction record, and $5,000 in fines for buying two guns in one month is fair, reasonable, tough on crime, and constitutional in nature. Go ahead and try. We'll wait.","What is conveniently missing from your response? An explanation of why a limit on the number of guns that can be purchased during a certain time period is not a law which imposes ""conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms"" per Heller. If the punishment does not fit the crime it does not necessarily follow that the crime is Constitutionally protected. Executing someone for shoplifting would be unjustifiable.

Adult heterosexual consenting non-related parents whose procreation is almost guaranteed to cause genetic defects? We leave it to them to decide and choose the preventive measures. Related?

RQ,0,RQ_notsarc_0152,"that just shows how nutty it is. using your argument, someone could reject all scientific theories because most of them are wrong: apparently even yec are in this sense more rational than dawkins. the claim that faith is accepted mainly because people are told to is very dodgy. religion seems to naturally arise, although there are many theories as to how and why, religious and otherwise. think of religion like morality: the idea varies, but seems to exist everywhere and often seems to appeal to the same things. it is often 'taught' but this does not mean it does not occur naturally: indeed, a system of explaining away what would otherwise be ethical/religious is needed, and this requires a more direct and deliberate move: thus the cack-handed attempts at replacing religion with deliberate human constructs.","daniel dennett asks, how did just one species, homo sapiens, acquire the numinous perspective that can have such a profound influence on people's lives? he seems to think that religions evolved and originally served a 'primitive' philosophical intention - such as explaining the hidden 'causes' of natural events in pre-scientific societies. to give just one example: the rise and fall of the tides were observed, but not understood. so the phenomena were attributed to the power of a god (or gods) etc. i think this is a pretty commonplace answer, but not necessarily wrong.  why has religion survived the scepticism of the intellectual enlightenment and the rational attacks of science? the idea that some fundamental 'psychic need' in humanity is satisfied by having religious beliefs seems (to me) the most promising speculation."

RQ,0,RQ_notsarc_0419,"which is why it should be done on a case-by-case basis. sometimes there can be an age gap of 5 years and it could still be consensual, so imo fine, but other times it could be 4 years age difference and not fine (eg, a 14 year old and a ten year old) i'm not really sure how that analogy is relevant. -wez",your right about the 14 year old and the ten year old but if it is a 18 and 14 should that be legal? or 18 and 15? 16 and 21 is legal (although it is wrong) because the youngest one is still legal. age of consent = 16 years old. if your basing it on a year gap what about 10 years? i am 10 years older than my fiance. before anyone jumps to conclusions i am 38. and she is 28. legal? why? we are both over 16.......period.
RQ,0,RQ_notsarc_0420,"personally i don't give rats rear end about your god - neither he, you, the government or the ignoramous in rome will ever have say in what happens to this body. yes there are - and as long as you continue to trivialize and disregard them you will not to a damned thing to reduce abortion.","have you ever considered the possibility that he cares about you? that he knows you? and that he cares about those in the womb? this is always the charge hurled at me but it is never founded. you cannot find any misogyny in my writings but rather a great respect for women and their value and dignity. this is why i argue so strongly against abortion. yet, any oppression, or insecurity, or hardship, or difficulty they face, though real and challenging, is not justified in the face of destroying the life in the womb. though abortion reigns freely and forcefully and abundantly still the oppression and abuse of women endure. one reason they endure is that people are looking in the wrong place for a solution--they are looking to abortion when it offers no solution."

RQ,0,RQ_notsarc_0422,"Sorry, I expanded my definitions here and was not polite enough to inform the rest of you :) I was not meaning to say JUST that nothing would be done about global warming (though I see now that it certainly appears that way). I am saying nothing will be done PERIOD. No preparation, nothing. We will wait until it is too late, act surprised when it happens, and then blame either the mexicans or the chinese. It is what we do.","As in we, do you mean we the USA or we, the World ? Because this is a World wide issue and not something the US can solve on its own in any case."
RQ,0,RQ_notsarc_0423,What we are left with are gods that have considerably little interaction with the world that we know.,"That who knows? Your use of ""we"" does not include many religious folk I assume. I would claim to know of much interaction that God has and has had with the world."
