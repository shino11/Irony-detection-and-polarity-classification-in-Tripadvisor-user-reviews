## Thesis: Irony detection and polarity classification in Tripadvisor user reviews

In this repository you will find several models for the classification of Trip Advisor reviews by irony and polarity, using supervised learning algorithms.

The first dataset, Sarcasm V2 [https://nlds.soe.ucsc.edu/sarcasm2], was constructed from a large-scale and highly diverse dialogue corpus of online discussion forums to classify into sarcasm (S) and non-sarcasm (NS) classes, distributed into three balanced sample subsets based on generic sarcasm (Gen), rhetorical questions (RQ), and hyperbole (Hyp)(Oraby etÂ al., 2017). 

The second dataset are 1254 reviews about Amazon productos [https://storm.cis.fordham.edu/~filatova/SarcasmCorpus.rar].

The third dataset consists of 20,490 hotel reviews extracted from TripAdvisor [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/trip-advisor-hotel-reviews/download?datasetVersionNumber=2], which contain the star rating (up to 5) given by the user (Alam et al., 2016).

For word representation, three GloVe word embedding models are used,
